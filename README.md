# Nitrox Mixer
### This is very much a work in progress.  I would barely call this a prototype.  I'm not responsible for anyone or anything that happens form the use of this code or components.  

If you would like to submit changes please reach out to me at jeremy.k.bryson@gmail.com.  I hope this code gets better over time. I also have plans to make it into a Trimix mixer down the road.

## Important
